Quick Start
===========

The minimum python version currently supported is Python 3.11.

Use pip to install the hgraph package:

```bash
pip install hgraph
```

Now try the hello world example:

[hello world](hello_world.md)

You have now successfully run your first HGraph program.

Note: All examples are also available as python scripts in the docs/quick_start folder of the
project. This is great to try out the examples and play around with them.

Next, let's take a look as simple [graph and nodes](graphs_and_nodes.md).
