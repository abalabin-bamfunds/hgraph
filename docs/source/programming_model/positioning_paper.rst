HGraph: Functional Reactive Programming in Python
==================================================

Abstract
--------

HGraph is an implementation of the Functional Reactive Programming (FRP) paradigm in Python. This document provides
a description of FRP, how HGraph implements FPG and how the implementation matches the FRP model.


Introduction
------------

Functional Reactive Programming (FRP) is a programming paradigm that combines functional programming with reactive programming.
The landmark paper describing this approach is "Functional reactive animation" :cite:`elliott1997functional`.
