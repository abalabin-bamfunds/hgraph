Time-Series Types
=================

The time-series types are the key types in the HGraph library as they provide the ports to support connecting
outputs and inputs together forming edges in the graph.

The base of all time-series types is:

.. autoclass:: hgraph.TimeSeries
    :members:
    :undoc-members:

.. autoclass:: hgraph.TimeSeriesOutput
    :members:
    :undoc-members:
    :show-inheritance:

.. autoclass:: hgraph.TimeSeriesInput
    :members:
    :undoc-members:
    :show-inheritance:
