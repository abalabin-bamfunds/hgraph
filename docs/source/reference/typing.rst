Typing
======

The typing system is managed using a meta data wrapper for the Python types along with the appropriate extraction
logic to parse a signature to extract the types. The entry point into the type meta-data system is:

.. autoclass:: hgraph.HgTypeMetaData
    :members:
    :undoc-members:
